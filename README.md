## ‚ôø Accessibility Focus

This game was designed from the ground up with inclusivity as the primary goal.

#### **For Visual Impairment:**
* **Path-Aware Audio:** The guiding chime's volume is tied to the shortest walking path, making it a reliable navigation tool.
* **Stereo Panning:** The chime's sound pans left or right to give a general sense of direction.
* **Directional Sonar:** The spacebar ping mechanic allows players to "feel out" their immediate surroundings and make informed choices without sight.

#### **For Hearing Impairment:**
* **High-Contrast Visuals:** The 8-bit art style uses a clear, high-contrast color palette.
* **Visual Sound Indicators:** The border of the game container glows with an intensity proportional to the proximity sound's volume.
* **Descriptive Captions:** The caption box provides text-based cues for key game events and proximity.

#### **For Autism Spectrum Disorder:**
* **Predictable Structure:** The grid-based maze and consistent rules reduce anxiety.
* **Calming Aesthetic:** The soft color palette, non-intrusive sounds, and pixel art are designed to be engaging without being overwhelming.
* **Clear Objectives & Feedback:** The goal is simple (find the treasure), and feedback is immediate and positive.
